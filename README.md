# Zen Time: Meditation Timer üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Go to app: [Zen Time](https://zen-time.netlify.app/)

Zen Time is a simple meditation timer application that offers an audio-guided meditation experience. It is built using React, Tailwind CSS, and the audio capabilities of Tone.js.

## WELCOME

Zen Time integrates sound with your meditation. You can start by selecting your desired meditation duration. Once you press "Start", the timer initiates its countdown. As it progresses, you'll be enveloped by calming sounds designed to guide you into a deep state of meditation. These auditory cues not only help you relax and drift off, but they also evolve as your session continues. Over time, the sounds slow down and resonate as if they're gradually becoming distant, fostering a peaceful ambiance.

We sincerely hope Zen Time enhances tranquility and peace during your meditation sessions. üôè
