# Zen Time: Meditation Timer üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Zen Time is a simple meditation timer application, designed to offer a seamless meditation experience. It's using React, complemented by Tailwind CSS and the audio capabilities of Tone.js.

## WELCOME

Zen Time is a meditation timer with sound. First, select the preferred time you want to meditate. Upon pressing "Start", the timer begins its countdown. As it runs, you'll be greeted with calming sounds that aim to guide you into a deep state of meditation. These sounds are crafted to help you calm down and drift off. As time progresses, the sounds slow down, creating an ambiance that feels more distant and peaceful.

We hope that Zen Time brings tranquility and focus to your meditation practices. üôè
